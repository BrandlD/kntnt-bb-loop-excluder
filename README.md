# Kntnt's Exclude Duplicated Posts for Beaver Builder

Makes it possible to avoid duplicated posts when using Beaver Builder custom query.

## Description

The Beaver Builder plugin provides several post modules that uses custom query as source. If you use any of these modules on posts, you can exclude the current post from the query. This plugin extends that option to exclude all posts returned by previous instances of any of these modules on the post.

Thus, you only need this plugin if you intend to put more than one post module on a page or layout and want tp avoid duplicated posts.

## Installation
